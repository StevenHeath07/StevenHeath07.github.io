## 🚀 About Me
 
Hi!, I'm Steven Heath, I am a 17 year old college student currently studying at the 12 Quays campus at Wirral Met College, UK. I started learning about programming at the age of 14 when I was introduced to Python, ever since then I have wanted to learn more about programming and improve. I am currently in my second year for my course which is T-Level Digital Production, Design and Development.
